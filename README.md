# Strategic Aid Allocation for Global Development

Optimizing humanitarian aid allocation for HELP International by leveraging socio-economic and health indicators. Utilizing data analytics to identify countries in dire need for targeted assistance from a recent $10 million funding initiative.









## Project Description

This project endeavors to address the critical challenge of strategically and effectively allocating resources to countries in dire need of aid. HELP International, an international humanitarian NGO committed to fighting poverty and providing relief during disasters, has recently secured $10 million in funding. Now, the question arises: How can this money be utilized to bring about the most impactful and positive change?

As a data Scientist, my role is to leverage socio-economic and health factors to categorize countries based on their overall development status. By employing clustering techniques, we aim to identify and recommend priority countries that require immediate attention and aid. This data-driven initiative will provide valuable insights to HELP International's CEO, facilitating informed decision-making to maximize the impact of the allocated funds.

### Objective
- The objective of this project is to utilize data-driven methodologies to categorize countries based on socio-economic and health indicators. 
- the project aims to identify nations that are most in need of humanitarian aid.
- providing HELP International with strategic insights for effective allocation of funds and resources.


## Project Approach.
1.  **Data Exploration**
- The dataset consists of 9 features, each capturing information on socio-economic and health indicators for various countries. like GPD, child mortaliry rate, income, health, imports etc. An initial exploration provides insights into the overall structure of the data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**
Explain the steps taken to clean and preprocess the data, addressing missing values, outliers, and any feature engineering performed.
- **Clustering Analysis**
Detail the application of clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means or hierarchical clustering) to categorize countries based on identified factors.
- **Evaluation**
Describe the metrics and methods used to evaluate the quality of clustering results.
- **Insights and Recommendations**
Summarize the actionable insights derived from the clustering analysis and provide recommendations for prioritizing countries in need.

### Why Clustering
- Clustering provides a data-driven methodology for decision-making. Instead of arbitrary or subjective criteria, the clustering algorithm objectively groups countries based on the underlying patterns present in the data.
- Clustering will group countries with similar socio-economic and health indicators. This helps in identifying regions or groups of countries facing comparable challenges and in need of similar types of aid.
